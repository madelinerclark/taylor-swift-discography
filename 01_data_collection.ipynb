    "This notebook is the first in a series of notebooks analyzing Taylor Swift's discography; in this notebook, I collect and compile data using [parsel](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to webscrape from [Genius](https://genius.com/), an online music encyclopedia, and pandas for dataframe creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that Genius does have an [API](https://docs.genius.com/) for application development. However, song lyrics are not made available via API, which is a crucial component of this project. A third-party Python package, [lyricsgenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/), is available to work in tandem with the API, webscraping on the user's behalf. I tested both the API and lyricsgenius as resources before ultimately concluding to collect the data myself.\n",

    "## Webscraping and Initial Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Genius is very thorough in cataloguing an artist's discogrpahy, tracking all physical and digital variants of a release with different tracklists as well as singles, EPs, demo CDs, official playlists, and special releases. Therefore, Genius catalogues Taylor Swift as having over [100 different albums](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift/albums), most of which contain repeated songs. For sake of processing times, I manually select the releases used to create the initial dataframe: deluxe versions and \"Taylor's Version\" rerecordings of her studio albums are preferred for including all existing bonus tracks and \"From The Vault\" songs for each album, and non-album singles and streaming-specific EPs that contain previously unreleased tracks are included. Since this project includes analyses of her lyrics, the goal is to capture every *unique* song of her discography, not necessarily to capture every *possible* song.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **album_title**: the title of the album (or other release) containing each song\n",
    "* **album_url**: the URL to the Genius page for the album\n",
    "* **album_era**: the musical \"era\" the album was released in\n",
    "  * Note: this terminology was brought about via [The Eras Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour) and usually refers to the time period around a studio album's release. For songs not on studio albums, the era is determined by which era was closest when written or released.\n",
    "* **album_track_number**: the track number for the song on the given album\n",
    "* **song_title**: the title of the song\n",
    "* **song_url**: the URL to the Genius page for the song\n",
    "* **song_lyrics**: the lyrics to the song (returned as a single string)\n",
    "* **song_writers**: the writer(s) for the song (returned as a list)\n",
    "* **song_producers**: the producers(s) for the song (returned as a list)\n",
    "* **song_tags**: the genre tag(s) for the song (returned as a list)\n",

For example, the streaming-specific EP, *The More Lover Chapter*, contains five songs: four songs are also on the standard release of the parent album, *Lover*, while only one song is a unique release. There are also numerous remixes and alternative versions of the same songs that are still the same lyrically. Both these remixes and repeated songs need to be removed from the dataframe; the latter can be easily filtered out while the former requires some manual work. I also choose to remove the five-minute version of \"All Too Well\" from the dataframe, as it's a shorter version of the ten-minute version and may potentially cause problems during analysis.\n",
