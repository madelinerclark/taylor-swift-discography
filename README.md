# taylor_swift_discography
This repository contains a series of notebooks analyzing Taylor Swift's discography:

* **01_data_collection**: initial webscraping from [Genius](https://genius.com/) using [parsel](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), creating a dataframe of Taylor Swift songs and lyrics.

The [datasets folder](./datasets) includes JSON, CSV, and pickle versions of the webscraping data.
