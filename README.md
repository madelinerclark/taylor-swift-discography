# taylor_swift_discography
This repository contains a series of Python modules and notebooks compiling and analyzing Taylor Swift's discography:

* **01_data_collection**: initial webscraping from [Genius](https://genius.com/) using [parsel](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), creating a dataframe and database of Taylor Swift songs and lyrics.
* *TBD*

The [data folder](./data) includes pickle and database versions of the webscraping data.
